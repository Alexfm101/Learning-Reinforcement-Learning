# Learning Reinforcement learning

This respo is about my journey studying RL, I will trying to implement from the most classic algorithms to advance deep RL algorithms using OpenAI gym in differents enviroments. Also i will using the "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" from Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto where i think is the best book for start in this machine learning area and the repo of "reinforcement-learning"  by dennybritz that have many exercises for practice.
